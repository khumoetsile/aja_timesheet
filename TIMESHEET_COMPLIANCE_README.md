# Smart Timesheet Compliance Monitoring System

## Overview

The Smart Timesheet Compliance Monitoring System is an intelligent, real-time monitoring solution that helps administrators track staff compliance with timesheet requirements. The system considers business hours, weekends, and provides meaningful notifications based on configurable thresholds.

## Features

### üéØ **Intelligent Compliance Calculation**
- **Business Hours Aware**: Only counts missed hours during business hours (8 AM - 5 PM, Monday-Friday)
- **Weekend Exclusion**: Automatically excludes weekends from compliance calculations
- **After-Hours Handling**: Recognizes when staff are outside business hours
- **Smart Thresholds**: Warning after 8 hours, Critical after 24 hours

### üìä **Real-Time Dashboard**
- **Summary Cards**: Total staff, compliant users, warnings, and critical issues
- **Compliance Table**: Detailed view of each staff member's compliance status
- **Department Filtering**: Filter by department to focus on specific areas
- **Search Functionality**: Find specific staff members quickly
- **Pagination**: Handle large numbers of staff efficiently

### üîî **Smart Notifications**
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Instant notifications for compliance issues
- **Browser Notifications**: Desktop notifications for critical issues
- **Bulk Actions**: Send notifications to multiple critical users at once
- **Alert Management**: Acknowledge and dismiss alerts as needed

### üìà **Advanced Analytics**
- **Risk Assessment**: Low, Medium, High risk levels based on compliance status
- **Business Hours Tracking**: Count of actual business hours missed
- **Next Expected Entry**: Calculates when staff should submit their next entry
- **Compliance Trends**: Historical data for trend analysis (future enhancement)

## How It Works

### 1. **Compliance Status Calculation**

The system automatically determines each user's compliance status:

- **Compliant**: Within 8 hours of last entry
- **Warning**: 8-24 hours since last entry
- **Critical**: 24+ hours since last entry
- **Weekend**: Current time is weekend (low risk)
- **After Hours**: Current time is after 5 PM (low risk)

### 2. **Business Hours Logic**

```typescript
// Default business hours: 8 AM - 5 PM, Monday-Friday
const businessHours = {
  startHour: 8,      // 8 AM
  endHour: 17,       // 5 PM
  excludeWeekends: true,
  excludeHolidays: true
};
```

### 3. **Smart Thresholds**

- **Warning Threshold**: 8 hours (configurable)
- **Critical Threshold**: 24 hours (configurable)
- **Auto-refresh**: Every 15 minutes
- **Alert Monitoring**: Every 5 minutes
