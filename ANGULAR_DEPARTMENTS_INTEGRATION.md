## 📁 **File Structure**

```
src/app/
├── services/
│   └── departments-management.service.ts    # API service
├── admin/components/
│   └── departments-management.component.ts  # Main component

```

## 🔧 **API Integration**

The Angular service connects to these backend endpoints:

- `GET /api/departments` - Get all departments
- `POST /api/departments/bulk-upload` - Upload departments and tasks
- `GET /api/departments/:id` - Get specific department
- `POST /api/departments` - Create department
- `PUT /api/departments/:id` - Update department
- `DELETE /api/departments/:id` - Delete department

## 🎨 **UI Features**

- **File Validation**: Only accepts .json files
- **Progress Indicators**: Shows upload status
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages

### **Results Display**

## 📱 **Responsive Design**

The component is fully responsive and works on:
- **Desktop**: Full grid layout with all features

## 🔐 **Security**

- **Authentication Required**: All API calls require valid JWT token
- **Admin Only**: Component only accessible to admin users
- **Input Validation**: File type and format validation
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without exposing internals

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

1. **Ensure Backend is Running**
   ```bash
   cd aja_backend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Start Angular Development Server**
   ```bash
   cd aja_timesheet
   ng serve
   ```

3. **Access the Feature**
   - Login as admin user
   - Navigate to "Departments" in the sidebar
   - Upload your JSON file

## 📊 **Data Format**

The component expects JSON data in this format:

```json
{
  "departments": [
    {
      "name": "Department Name",
      "description": "Department description",
      "is_active": true,
      "tasks": [
        {
          "name": "Task Name",
          "description": "Task description",
          "is_active": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

1. **Upload Fails**
   - Check that your JSON file is valid
   - Ensure you're logged in as admin
   - Verify backend API is running

2. **File Not Accepted**
   - Make sure file has .json extension
   - Check file size (should be reasonable)
   - Verify JSON format is correct

3. **Navigation Not Showing**
   - Ensure you're logged in as admin
   - Check that the route is properly configured
   - Refresh the page

### **Debug Mode**

Enable detailed logging by opening browser dev tools and checking the console for detailed error messages.

## 🔄 **Next Steps**

The component is ready to use! You can now:

1. **Upload your departments data** using the JSON file you have
2. **View and manage** existing departments
3. **Monitor upload results** with detailed statistics
4. **Integrate with existing workflows** as needed
